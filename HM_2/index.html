                <p>A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction since the 1880s, and of<br>
                    aerospace
                    engineering and scientific proposals
                    <strong>since the late 1940s.</strong> Plans include
                    landing<br> on Mars for
                    exploration at a minimum, with some considering exploring its moons Phobos<br> and Deimos.
                    Longterm
                    proposals have included sending settlers and starting terraforming of<br> the planet.

                <section class="section_exploration__text">
                    The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades.<br> Conceptual work
                    for
                    missions that would involve human explorers has been ongoing since<br> <span>the 1950s</span>, with
                    planned
                    missions
                    typically being stated as taking place anywhere between<br> 10 and 30 years from the time they are
                    drafted.The list of <strong>crewed</strong> Mars mission plans shows<br> the various mission
                    proposals
                    that have been
                    put
                    forth by multiple organizations and space<br> agencies in this field of space exploration. Plans
                    have
                    varied from scientific expeditions, in<br> which a small group (between two and eight astronauts)
                    would
                    visit Mars for a period of a few<br> weeks or year, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research
                    stations, colonization or<br> other continuous humanization).[citation needed] Virtual visits to
                    Mars,
                    using haptic<br> technologies, have also been proposed.[<br>
                    <em> In the 2010s</em>, numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing
                    proposals for<br> human
                    missions
                    to Mars.[citation needed] In fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration<br> and settlement in
                    books, graphic novels, and films..
